After highschool I pursued computer science which was a life long dream. I topped my batch and secured a perfect CGPA in my undergrad, while participating in many online/offline hackathons, coding competitions. My thesis and primary focus of research was on 3D convolutional neural network, machine learning and artifical intelligence.
